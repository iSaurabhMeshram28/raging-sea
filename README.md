# Raging Sea

Raging Sea is a dynamic and visually immersive ocean simulation built using **Three.js** and **GLSL**. This project combines advanced WebGL shaders with JavaScript to deliver realistic ocean animations and effects.

## Features

- üåä Realistic ocean wave animations using GLSL shaders.
- üì° Interactive Three.js scene for rendering 3D visuals.
- ‚ö° High-performance rendering optimized for modern browsers.
- üåê Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless integration.

## Technologies Used

- **GLSL**: For creating custom shaders and ocean wave effects.
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library for 3D rendering.
- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Logic and interactivity.
